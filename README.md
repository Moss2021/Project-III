# Project-III
Final Engagement
Overview

I am a Security Engineer for X-CORP, supporting the SOC infrastructure. The SOC Analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the Security Engineering team to investigate.

Started by confirming that newly created Kibana alerts are working, after which monitored live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system.

Finally, I reported back all my findings to both the SOC manager and the Engineering Manager with appropriate analysis.

Enjoy the Final Project presentation, as well as, three reports: 


- Defensive Security Report: Implemented alerts and thresholds determined to be be effective in Project II.


- Offensive Security Report:: Assessed a vulnerable VM and verified that the Kibana rules worked as expected.


- Network Forensics Report:: Used Wireshark to analyze live malicious traffic on the wire.
